A memory game built using Swift for iOS, built for a Grade 11 high school CS class. The user flips over two tiles, and if the tiles have the same image, they remain flipped over. The goal is to match all 12 pairs of images so that all images are flipped over, in as few move as possible.

The player can choose from 3 modes (fruits, sports, and programming langauges). If the user selects programming langauges mode, each time a user successfully matches two languages, a new screen will appear educating the user about the language. 

Here are a couple screenshots of the game:
